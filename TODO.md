# My todo list

Just want a place to keep track of what I want to do next. Might as well make it public.

Also there will be notes, they will be silly as I usually commit changes when it's really late.

- [ ] New particle system
  - [x] Basic Pooling system
  - [x] Extended FlxParticle
  - [x] Extended LERP with steps/stops
    - Original FlxParticle LERP just wasn't working for me
    - I've actually stripped out access to the original FlxParticle LERPs. An array with 2 stops at 0 and 1 do the same thing; though I do miss out on easings (for now...)
  - [x] Emitter function to replace current mana gain effect
  - [x] Emitter function for health gain
    - And it's in a script ðŸ˜‰
  - [x] Emitter function for damage taken
    - Kind of done, Fireball spell has a particle animation right now, but it isn't a generic "lose health" effect.
    - Both heal/damage might just be specific to the "spell" that does the effect
  - [x] Emitter function for gem change (Also a basic explosion)
    - First pass done and works on main menu on click and the "Light it up!" spell in game
  - [ ] Add easings to each stop
    - I think just adding an easing option to a stop and using the esing form the "lowest" stop is the best way to go.
  - [ ] Add property to change the particle sprite
    - Having some trouble finding nice sprites for this.
- [x] Data driven everything that is in the game now
  - Yes! Rather than adding more actual fun game stuff, I spent time doing silly technical things. ðŸ˜€
  - [x] Characters
    - [x] Characters definition in `Modding.md`
    - [x] Working (in game) character
  - [x] Spells
    - [x] Spells definition in `Modding.md`
    - [x] Working (in game) spells (All spells that are currently in game!)
  - [x] Effects
    - [x] Effects definition in `Modding.md`
    - [x] Working (in game) effects
    - This will be ongoing, there's **a lot** of work to do here. But the first full spell is in (Fireball, for the player).
- [x] Tooltips for spells
  - [x] Tooltips for spells in game on mouse hover
- [ ] x-match system
  - [x] New turn on 4+ match
  - [x] UI and/or text effect for new turn
  - [x] Do something on 5+ match (This is done, but needs balancing)
  - [ ] Do something on 6+ match?
- [x] Battle win/lose system
  - [x] Add a "win" and "lose" effect to the game
  - [x] Add a way to easily get back to the main menu ðŸ¤£
- [ ] Change Air to damage
  - [ ] Remove from character mana system
  - [ ] deal damage to other character on match
  - [ ] Find appropriate developer art for new gem
- [ ] Next version of enemy "AI"
  - [x] Add support for using spells
  - [ ] Rank required mana higher in potential matches pool
- [ ] Setup CI/CD for win/mac/linux/android versions
  - [ ] Setup GitHub runners on Server and/or MacMini
  - [ ] Setup GitHub actions
    - [ ] Build for Windows
    - [ ] Build for Mac
      - Actually, just because I might have to use an x86 version of haxe and stuff, it doesn't matter, as building the game with xCode will make it either Arm or universal anyway. Duh.
    - [ ] Build for Linux
    - [ ] Build for Android
- [ ] Add Controller support
- [ ] New Menu system
  - [x] Basic menu system
  - [x] arrow keys to select and enter to activate
  - [x] mouseover to select and click to activate
  - [x] Basic animations
  - [x] Multiple pages
  - [ ] joypad support
  - [ ] Number range selection
  - [ ] Select from array
  - [ ] more?
- [ ] Add a real main menu
  - [x] Add a "New Battle" button to main menu 
    - [x] add a list of current enemies to choose from
    - [ ] overhaul the loading system to load on play state init
      - It does, but only for the enemy. the player still has the single global state.
  - [ ] Add a "Options" button to menu
      - I added a toggle for full screen, it's a step.
  - [ ] Add a "Quit" button to main menu
- [ ] Add a Pause menu
  - [x] Add a "Resume" button to pause menu
  - [x] Add a "Quit" button to pause menu
  - [ ] Add a "Options" button to pause menu
- [ ] Add an Options menu
  - [ ] Add a Full Screen option (Put the stupid basic version on the main menu)
  - [ ] Add a "Quit"/"Back" button to options menu
- [ ] Particle system Extensions
  - [ ] See if there's some refinements for the particle system generation
    - It's a bit too much to write right now. But also not too bad, I guess.
    - Also, this might solve it's self when I move spells to data files
  - [ ] Split out the particle system into a library?
- [ ] Add Modding library [Polymod](https://polymod.io/)
  - [ ] Get the demo working in HTML5
